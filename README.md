# Energy Web Foundation: Certificate of Origin (EWF CoO)

## Warning

This repository is not designed for productive usage. Instead it should be used for demonstration and learning purposes.

## Getting Started

#### Contracts Overview

[Open in Piet](https://piet.slock.it/?gitHubRepo=energywebfoundation%2Few-origin&subDir=contracts&contract=CertificateLogic&contractAddress=0xefE4F05B363d216354749a1E0BE423b2e50291bD&rpc=https%3A%2F%2Frpc.slock.it%2Ftobalaba)


#### Install
Install the **Certificate of Origin**: `npm install`.

#### Clients 
The **Certificate of Origin** app can be deployed on any ethereum-network
- For testing purposes, we recommend deploying it on a local **ganache-rpc**
    - The app is pre-configured to start ganache with: `npm run start-ganache`

#### Migration

Deploy contracts to preferred network (default ganache-cli): `npm run migrate`

## Contract Functionality


### New Users and Role Changes

###### Contract : `UserDB.sol`
- A `TopAdmin` or `UserAdmin` can onboard new users with: `setUser()`
- After, the roles of the users have to be added by either calling:
    - `setRoles()`
    - `addRoles()`

### Producing Assets
Electricity Producing Implement

Example: Power Plant

#### Creating / Onboarding
(_The procedure for onboarding a producing asset is nearly the same as the consuming ones._)
###### Contract : `producingAssetRegistry.sol`

1. `createAsset()` (Roles: `TopAdmin` or `AssetAdmin`) 
    - returns your new `assetId` in event
2. `initProducingProperties(uint _assetId,`...`)`
3. `initGeneral(uint _assetId,`...`)`. 

(You should recieve a `LogAssetFullyInitialized` event including your `assetId`)

#### Logging Energy Consumption

`saveSmartMeterRead()` to log consumed energy

### Consuming Assets

Electricity Consuming Implement
Example: Factory


#### Creating / Onboarding an Asset

###### Contract : `consumingAssetRegistry.sol`
1. `createAsset()` (Roles: `TopAdmin` or `AssetAdmin`)
    - returns a new `assetId` in an event

_After receiving the `assetId` you're able to call the functions:_

2. `initGeneral(uint _assetId,`...`)`
3. `initLocation (uint _assetId,` ...`)`

(You should receive a `LogAssetFullyInitialized` event including your `assetId`)

#### Logging Energy Consumption

`saveSmartMeterRead()` to log consumed energy

### Demands

Electricity Demand

#### Creating a Demand

###### Contract : `DemandLogic.sol`

1. `createDemand()`: As `TopAdmin` or `AgreementAdmin`
    - Requires an array with 10 elements for the different properties that are enabled or disabled (see smart contracts).
2. `initGeneralAndCoupling()`
3. `initMatchProperties()`
4. `initPriceDriving()`

 The smart contract will require the following:
- The demand can't have both and originator and a specific producing asset
- If the producing asset is enabled, it must exist
- If the consuming asset is enabled, it must exists 
- The Matcher's address must have the Matcher's role


#### Matching a Demand
###### Contract : `DemandLogic.sol`


Ways to match:
- `matchCertificate()`: Match an Existing Certificate to a `demand`
- `matchDemand()`: Match Produced Energy to a `demand`

Internally both functions are calling the same functions for checking the compatibility of the `demand` and the energy `certificate`.

These functions can also be called before a transaction, to check if an error would result:
- `checkDemandCoupling()`
- `checkDemandGeneral()`
- `checkMatcher()`
- `checkPriceDriving()`


Only these certificates can be matched with demands:

| Condition | Result |
| :-- | :-- |
| The matching of produced energy with a demand was successfull | A new certificate is created with the buyer as new owner
| The demand is successfully matched with a certificate | The owner gets transfered |
| The produced energy does not match any demand | A new certificate will be created with the `assetOwner` as certificate-owner and an `escrow` address |
